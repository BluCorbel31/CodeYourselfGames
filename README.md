# CodeYourselfGames This is a fun little repository for games compatible with all OS in various languages that are intended to be coded yourself and tinkered with. 

# This guessing_game.rs file is a numerical guessing game in rust. Now have we a python pong game, tic tac toe in R and Snake in C.

#If you are here because of @TheMadHattersPlayground.com please go to the LinkedIn page attached to the live link in the shop and I'll talk to you there.

#If you are only able to have a single compiler use rustup and check out my multi-compiler next door please make sure you have an adult doing this if you are not one. Please make sure they read the ReadMe.md file first then the multi compiler readme.txt
