# CodeYourselfGames This is a fun little repository for games compatible with all OS in various languages that are intended to be coded yourself and tinkered with. 

# This guessing_game.rs file is my very first. It's a numerical guessing game in rust. More to follow. Now have a python pong game too.

#If you are here because of @TheMadHattersPlayground please go to the LinkedIn page attached to the live link in the shop and I'll talk to you there.
